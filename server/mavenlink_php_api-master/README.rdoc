= Mavenlink PHP API Library

{Mavenlink's}[http://mavenlink.com] project collaboration suite allows you to manage your business relationships, share files, and track project activity online from anywhere in the world. Within a project workspace in Mavenlink, you can agree on budget & schedule, track time, send invoices, get paid via PayPal, and complete work.

The Mavenlink API provides programmatic access to many of Mavenlink's capabilities, including projects, posts, tasks, and time entries.  This library will be a full-featured PHP client for the Mavenlink REST API.  Right now we have implemented example usage for creation and listing of Mavenlink objects.

== The REST API

We have full {REST API and Ruby client documentation on the wiki}[https://github.com/mavenlink/mavenlink_ruby_api/wiki].

== Example Usage

    require 'lib/mavenlink_api.php'

    $mavenlinkApi = new MavenlinkApi('<oauth_token>');

    // Get workspaces
    $workspaces_json = $mavenlinkApi->getWorkspaces();
    $workspaces = json_decode($workspaces_json);

    // Get a specific workspace
    $workspace_json = $mavenlinkApi->getWorkspace(<workspace ID>);

    // Get events
    $events_json = $mavenlinkApi->getEvents();

    // Create a post in a workspace (Please see the {REST API and Ruby client documentation on the wiki}[https://github.com/mavenlink/mavenlink_ruby_api/wiki] for valid parameters.)
    $response = $mavenlinkApi->createPostForWorkspace(<Workspace ID>, array('post[message]' => 'Test message'))

    // Update a post in a workspace
    $response = $mavenlinkApi->updateWorkspacePost(8, 20, array("post[message]" => "Updated message"));

    // Delete a workspace post
    $response = $mavenlinkApi->deleteWorkspacePost(8, 19)

    // Create a story in a workspace
    $response = $mavenlinkApi->createStoryForWorkspace(8, array('story[title]' => 'Test story', 'story[story_type]' => 'deliverable'));
    

=== Example Scripts

Try running our examples:

    1: Edit examples/api_example.php to include your Mavenlink OAuth API Token.
    2: Run
       php examples/api_example.php
       
       or

    1: Edit examples/test.php to include your Mavenlink OAuth API Token.
    2: cd into examples and Run
       php test.php

== Credentials

=== Finding your OAuth Token

Your OAuth API Token is available on your Mavenlink user settings page within the API tab. Follow the instructions to register your application and retrieve your OAuth token.

=== Security

For security, the API is provided over SSL only.  Additionally, you should consider your API OAuth token to be much like a password.  Someone with your token can make changes to your Mavenlink account and perform actions in your name.  If you believe that your token has been compromised, login to Mavenlink and revoke your OAuth token from your account user settings page.
